    "description": "The Fender\u00ae American Vintage II series presents a remarkably accurate take on the revolutionary designs that altered the course of musical history. Built with period-accurate bodies, necks and hardware, premium finishes and meticulously voiced, year-specific pickups, each instrument captures the essence of authentic Fender craftsmanship and tone. During the late \u201850s and early \u201860s, the popularity of Fender musical instruments flourished, and although the Fender assortment had expanded to include many great new instruments, the Stratocaster\u00ae reigned supreme. By 1961, the Stratocaster had taken on a more refined aesthetic, with a 3-Color Sunburst reformulated with a more vibrant red and bolder black edge, topped with a 3-ply pickguard accenting the Strat\u2019s signature curves. Featuring a premium alder body, a trio of Pure Vintage 1961 Stratocaster pickups and a medium \u201cC\u201d-Shaped maple neck mated with a 7.25\u201d radius slab rosewood fingerboard, the American Vintage II 1961 Stratocaster reproduces the quintessential tone and feel of the original. Other appointments include a vintage-accurate synchronized tremolo with cold rolled steel block and bent steel saddles, single-line \u201cFender Deluxe\u201d tuners and 3-ply pickguard. The instruments in the American Vintage II series are direct descendants of the original Fenders: designed for players with a fine appreciation for vintage Fender tone and feel and built with unmatched quality, down to the last screw. These are Fender electrics in their purest form: Fender American Vintage II, the stuff of legends.

    "description": "MORE ABOUT LIMITED EDITION 70TH ANNIVERSARY BROADCASTER\u00ae Fender changed the music world forever in October 1950 with the first dual-pickup electric Spanish guitar\u2014the Broadcaster\u00ae. The instrument vaulted Fender into the mainstream of electric guitar, with gorgeous features and smart innovations including an ash body with a translucent blonde nitrocellulose finish, sturdy maple neck with rear-installed truss rod for solid stability (with a walnut \u201cskunk stripe\u201d), single-ply black phenolic pickguard, two loud-and-clear pickups and versatile wiring for three distinctive tone settings. Revolutionary as it was, however, the Broadcaster was short lived\u2014produced only for a couple months until January 1951 because of an already-existing trademark on the name held by the Fred Gretsch Manufacturing Company, Inc.. Now, for 2020 alone, the Custom Shop has resurrected this famously rare guitar in honor of its 70th anniversary. The Limited Edition 70th Anniversary Broadcaster has a two-piece select ash body with off-center seam, available in four different Custom Shop aging packages\u2014NOS Time Capsule, Journeyman Relic\u00ae, Relic and Heavy Relic\u2014all finished in the original \u201cflash coat\u201d lacquer. The one-piece rift-sawn maple neck has a 1950 Broadcaster profile, 7.25\u201d-9.5\u201d vintage compound-radius fingerboard and 21 medium vintage frets. Other features include hand-wound \u201950-\u201951 Blackguard pickups with \u201951 modded \u201cNocaster\u201d wiring (similar to the original, with blender pot and slightly brighter rhythm setting in the neck position).

    "description": "Time-Honoured Ash Body This \u201955 Strat is constructed from a 2-piece Ash body, much like the very first Fender guitars constructed in the \u201950s. Not only does this particular material give the guitar a forgiving weight, but its resonant and vibrant tonal qualities also offer a strong voice \u2013 serving as the perfect sonic foundation for the sweet-sounding pickups. It has all the brightness and sustain you that gives a Strat it\u2019s bell-like chime! Old-School Feel, Modern Playability The \u201965 Strat C  is a great allrounder. If you\u2019re used to a Modern C Fender profile you\u2019ll feel right at home. It is the same width as a modern C and a similar profile, but is a bit chunkier, giving the guitar tonnes of sustain. The Maple neck on this Strat is Quarter Sawn, this is the strongest grain direction for the neck, giving it rock solid stability. It is also more resistant to warping or bowing in changing weather conditions and climates. The is finished nitrocellulose lacquer which has been worn on the back of the neck, leaving satin finish, beloved for its silky smooth feel. The Neck is topped off with a thick slab AAA grade Rosewood fingerboard. Rosewood has a velvety soft feel that simply glides under the fingers, and it adds warmth and midrange to the tone, that smooths out the high end, for a raunchy, warm tone that\u2019s been heard from countless Strat players such as Stevie Ray Vaughan and and John Mayer. The compound radius fretboard flattens from a 9.5\u2033 at the nut to 12\u2033 radius \u2013 giving it a modern feel, perfectly suited to fast legato licks and scorching solos. This allows for comfortable barre chords towards the neck, but a flatter radius up top which can allow for a lower action without notes fretting out when you bend. The fretboard is complete with 21 Narrow Tall frets for a perfect blend of vintage tone and modern playability. They offer the height of a modern fret, giving you a familiar feel, but their narrow construction ensures that the \u201cwoodiness\u201d of your tone stays intact, as you would get with a smaller, vintage fret. Vintage Voice The finishing touch to this beautiful instrument is the Fender Custom Shop hand-wound \u201960/\u201963 pickups, offering a full and dynamic vintage Strat tone. At between 6.2k and 6.47k output, they offer a powerful vintage sound that gives warm, blooming cleans and smooth, singing overdrive. The pickups have vintage correct hand bevelled, staggered Alnico V pole pieces. Alnico V offers a punchy tone with crisp highs and present lows. The pickups are wrapped in Formvar magnet wire, which enhances bass response for a classic throaty Strat tone. The middle pickup is reverse wound / reverse polarity which allows for hum-cancellation in positions 2 and 4, and delivers those iconic clean, quacky \u201cin-between\u201d stat positions.",

    "description": "SLOWHAND SOUND AND STYLE Experience the peerless Strat\u00ae style of Slowhand himself with the Eric Clapton Stratocaster, one of our most acclaimed and enduring artist signature models. With classic design and special features that give it exceptional tonal versatility and effortless feel worthy of one of the world\u2019s greatest names in rock and blues, it puts pure Clapton Stratocaster tone and feel straight into your hands. FEATURES Alder body Vintage Noiseless\u2122 pickups Active mid-boost and TBX tone circuits Special \u201csoft V\u201d neck profile Vintage-style blocked synchronized tremolo bridge Soft V Neck Profile \u201cSOFT V\u201d NECK PROFILE The \u201csoft V\u201d neck profile (the shape of the neck in cross section) on the Eric Clapton Stratocaster has a distinctly comfortable fretting-hand feel that takes the more pronounced sharpness of a \u201950s \u201cV\u201d profile and \u201csoftens\u201d it into a somewhat more rounded shape. Ideal for players with larger hands whose thumb extends over the edge of the fingerboard. TBX Tone Control TBX TONE CONTROL The first tone control knob operates this guitar\u2019s TBX (Treble Bass Expander) tone circuitry. The knob has a detent at the center position (5) and works like a normal tone control from zero to the detent. Turning the knob clockwise from the detent adds presence and brightness; turning it counterclockwise from the detent rolls off high frequencies. Active Mid Boost ACTIVE MID BOOST The second tone control knob functions as an active mid-boost control. Turning it clockwise boosts mid and bass frequencies while decreasing treble frequencies. Blocked Tremolo BLOCKED TREMOLO The Eric Clapton Stratocaster comes with an easily removable wood block installed between the tremolo block and tremolo cavity wall to keep it from moving, as specified by the great guitarist himself. Urethane Finish URETHANE FINISH Urethane guitar body finishes are especially strong and durable, and will hold colors with great vividness, sheen and clarity for extraordinarily long periods. 9.5 Fingerboard Radius 9.5\u2033 FINGERBOARD RADIUS The fingerboard radius is an important spec that describes the amount of curvature across the width of the fingerboard. This instrument\u2019s modern 9.5 fingerboard radius is slightly more flattened than a vintage-style radius, but still with enough arc to provide a natural and notably comfortable fretting-hand feel, and to make bending notes easier.",

    "description": "The Heart and Soul of a True \u201952 Leo Fender\u2019s 1952 Telecaster legitimized the electric guitar as a mainstream instrument. Session blues and country players praised the Tele for its blue-collar price and trendsetting looks. And with it, artists like Jimmy Page and Keith Richards shaped the very sound of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. The Fender American Original \u201950s Telecaster has the heart and soul of a true \u201952. Period correct are this Tele\u2019s strong, straight-grained ash body with single-ply phenolic pickguard and brass barrel saddles; hand-filling baseball bat \u201cU\u201d maple neck; spanky maple fingerboard with vintage-tall frets and black dot inlays; and painstakingly correct, copper-plated Pure Vintage \u201952 pickups. Yet tailored for the modern player is the comfortable 9.5\u2033 fingerboard, which minimizes fretting out as you move up the neck. Celebrate this electrified period in music history with the Fender American Original \u201950s Telecaster from Sweetwater. Neck - Fender American Original '50s Telecaster Classic \u201cU\u201d neck with a modern fingerboard radius For thumb-behind players who like a good, solid neck in the hand, this Tele\u2019s \u201950s \u201cU\u201d profile is aces. Where the American Original \u201950s Telecaster has the advantage over a classic \u201952 is its enlarged 9.5\u2033 (from 7.25\u2033) fingerboard radius, which allows for upper-register leads and bends with less risk of fretting out. Pickups - Fender American Original '50s Telecaster Pure Vintage \u201952 pickups These Pure Vintage \u201952 single-coils are as period correct as they come, from the fiber bobbins and Alnico III magnets right down to the enamel-coated coil wire and cloth-covered output wires. The steel base plates are even copper-plated for authenticity. The woody twang and delicate dynamics of the American classic are reborn in this stunning tribute. Ash body with a vintage nitro finish This Tele gets an extra dash of \u201950s authenticity with its ash body and nitrocellulose lacquer finish, which doesn\u2019t just let the wood breathe, but permits authentic wear as it ages. If you\u2019re looking for a modern player with \u201950s inspiration, look no further than the Fender American Original \u201950s Hardware - Fender American Original '50s Telecaster VINTAGE-CORRECT HARDWARE From the bridge to the string tree and tuning machines, every piece of hardware is just like the original. Fingerboard - Fender American Original '50s Telecaster FINGERBOARD & FRETS This 9.5\u201d-radius fingerboard is slightly flatter than a vintage-style 7.25\u201d radius, providing a comfortable fret-hand feel. Vintage-tall frets make it easier to bend notes without fretting out.",

    "description": "DM-8 The DM-8 drum kit is the newest kit from NUX using new technology to give the drummer an authentic acoustic feel and comes with all mesh heads by REMO. The kit is high quality and features a sturdy rack system which is not only durable but looks great.It loaded with great features to give the drummer a realistic expressive playing feel in this great package. Let\u2019s jump in and examine some of the features of this great kit and what we enjoyed when reviewing it. What\u2019s in the DM-8 Hi-Hat The hi-hat mounted on a standalone hi hatstand gives a more realistic feel as opposed to a fixed pad, the hi hat pad isagain of high quality and is mounted onto a motion sensor unit and there aresettings for Open/Closed and Half Open hi hats so you can adjust the hats asyou want them. 12inches independent snare drum The snare pad emulates a real acoustic snare drum with rim and shell design like a acoustic snare. The triple zone which allows you to play convincing rim shots/and cross sticks adapting to the needs of most playing situations from rock/funk/to latin and the cross stick is great for ballads or bossa nova. The snare uses the latest three-point trigger technology, which makes the sound of each position on the drum head more balanced. It also comes with a very stable independent snare stand, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the snare drum moving during performance. The new 10\u2019 kick and kick pedal The newly designed 10-inch independent kick drum can fully support a double bass pedal. And use an adjustable elastic mesh material, so that users can get the desired response. The new kick pedal features a double chainstay and a thicker soleplate. The double chain design makes the beater swing more stable. The thickened base plate keeps the entire pedal from moving freely. GROUP FADER The sound module is loaded with greatfeatures and an eye-catching feature is the individual pad adjustment faderwhere you can adjust the sound level of each pad; want to fade out? Simply movethe slider to the bottom of any pad to do this. The newly designed DM-8 comes with 30 sets of high-fidelity self-sampled drum kits with different styles. No matter what style of drummer you are, you can get the sound you want from it. Intuitive and powerful sound customization features allow users to freely edit their own drum kits. You can assign any sound to the rim or head. USBAUDIO The DM-8 module is an audio recording interface in itself, with the ability tosend stereo sound and MIDI data to a Mac or Windows computer via a single USB cable. This lets you record discrete audio and MIDI drum tracks in any DAW, ortrigger sounds in software-based drum instruments for studio or live playing. When you use the DM-8 as an audio interface and record through a DAW, you canseparate the audio signal into 14 separate tracks, which is very convenient formixing. WAV FILES (IMPORT OR DELETE) DM-8 has a brand new function, you can make any sound into a WAV file and put itinto a USB flash drive. Then upload the sound to the module through the U disk.Finally, you can assign this sound to any drum pad to play. EFFECTS The DM-8 has a good array of effects,simply go into the menu and select EFFECT there you will see six effectsettings. One especially good feature is the Pad EQ so if you feel like addinga bit more punch or low end or perhaps a bit more treble to any one of yourpads then this can be done by adjusting the individual sliders forhigh/middle/or low end; we especially liked the extra punch on the snare byadding more bass sound to it when EQ was applied. Of course we also havecompressor, overdrive and reverb. Jamming and Recording The DM-8 has a good selection of internal songs that you can play along with, sohow about jamming along to a little jazz or pop? Well, you can do this right out of the box as they say and makes it far more interesting than just playingon your own. If you want to analyze your playing. You can record your drumming onto a USBmemory stick or upload your favorite backing track and play along with it, save it as a WAV file and from here you will be able to analyze your playing byhearing the whole track back. Of course, the AUX IN interface also supports connecting your playback device toplay music.Anda variety of adjustment functions allow you to balance the volume of drums andbacking tracks directly on the module.",

    "description": "TD-17KVX2 Become a better drummer faster. When you\u2019re serious about drumming, you need a kit to match your ambition. The TD-17 V-Drums series has become the kit of choice for many drummers with its unbeatable combination of great quality, superior sound, and practical kit configurations. The refreshed TD-17 V-Drums lineup lets your technique and expression shine through, backed with inspiring training tools to push you further. An updated TD-17 sound engine, responsive mesh-head pads, and newly developed thin cymbals deliver a high-end experience that\u2019s stunningly close to playing acoustic drums. Meanwhile, an array of built-in coaching functions track your technique, measure your progress, and increase your motivation every day. With the TD-17 series, the journey to becoming a better drummer is faster than you can imagine. Roland V-Drums TD-17 Series and VAD307 Overview If you want to become a better drummer faster, the refreshed TD-17 V-Drums series provides an unbeatable combination of great quality, superior sound, and practical kit configurations. Onboard training tools allow you to hone your technique and let your expression shine through. If you regularly play acoustic drums, you shouldn\u2019t have to change or compromise your style with an electronic kit. The TD-17 lets you use the same acoustic playing techniques, thanks to the large 12-inch snare and a natural feeling hi-hat* that can be mounted on an acoustic hi-hat stand. And with a supremely playable collection of kits on board, you\u2019ll experience the authentic character and tone of acoustic drums with lightning-fast response time. *VH-10 V-Hi-Hat included with TD-17KVX2 model only. Realistic Pads for Uncompromising Performance The TD-17KV2 and TD-17KVX2 kits come with enhanced snare and cymbal pads for an even more authentic drumming experience. The 12-inch PDX-12 snare and 10-inch PDX-8 tom pads feature tension-adjustable mesh heads for customizable acoustic-like response and rebound. In addition, the PDX-12 has a traditional hoop height to hit open rimshots with a natural stick angle. Both kits also include newly developed thin V-Cymbals that attach to the stands with a special pivot mount, providing acoustic-style swing motion and stick response when played. Ideal for Perfecting Hi-Hat Techniques The TD-17KVX2 comes with the VH-10 V-Hi-Hat, which uses a single-cymbal floating design that mounts on a traditional acoustic hi-hat stand. It provides the same playing feel as an acoustic hi-hat, with a natural rebound and authentic swinging motion when you strike the pad. And with bow/edge triggering and smooth open/closed sounds, you can execute traditional playing techniques to perfection. Great Sounds Lead to Great Performances The TD-17\u2019s sound engine delivers a superior drumming experience, thanks to its advanced onboard Prismatic Sound Modeling. Just like acoustic drums, you can play with wide dynamic range and dramatic tonal changes depending on where and how hard you strike the pad. From rimshots, rolls, flams, and ghost notes on the snare to natural hi-hat transitions, dramatic crash hits, sustained cymbal swells, and more, every nuance is detailed, accurate, and ultra-smooth. The Feel of an Acoustic Kick Drum (but Quieter) A nice, solid kick drum usually comes with a nice, loud noise. Sometimes that\u2019s exactly what you want, but your family or neighbors may not feel the same. The KD-10 Kick Pad absorbs most of the impact noise thanks to its carefully engineered rubber components and cushion, all while retaining that satisfying acoustic kick drum \u201cthud\u201d when a beater is buried in a full-size head. In addition to keeping the noise down, the versatile design is compatible with all standard kick pedals, both single and double. Slimmer, Low-Profile Cymbals All cymbals in the TD-17 series feature thinner profiles than previous generations, offering more natural movement and improved stick feel. Each cymbal can also be choked simply by grabbing the edge\u2014just like a real acoustic cymbal. The 14-inch CY-14R-T ride cymbal even includes three-way triggering with independent sounds for the edge, bow, and bell. Acoustic Drumming Techniques Accepted Here Although each model in the TD-17 series can fit into smaller spaces at home, they\u2019re outfitted for professional performance. Across the entire range, the position and angle of each pad are fully adjustable, and the overall layout is comparable to an acoustic kit. Join Your Favorite Band. No Audition Necessary While playing endless drum solos is undeniably fun, it only takes you so far. With the TD-17, you can push your drumming further by playing along with your favorite bands\u2014including your own. Wirelessly stream music from your smartphone via Bluetooth audio and listen to the entire performance through your headphones. You can even record your performance to hear where you need to tighten things up. Play with Your Band\u2014Wherever They Are If you\u2019re in a band, getting everyone together can be challenging. But rather than going to rehearsals, how about bringing rehearsals to you? Work on your drum parts daily by playing along to finished songs, demos, and backing tracks streamed from your phone. Once you\u2019re back with the band in person, you\u2019ll be more than ready. Record. Listen. Learn. Listening back to your drumming is one of the best ways to improve. The TD-17 module has an onboard recorder that lets you hear and evaluate what you actually played\u2014not what you thought you played. Record solo sessions or drum along with the TD-17 demo songs, audio stored on an SD card, or music streamed from your phone. Along with self-evaluation, it\u2019s an easy way to capture high-quality audio for YouTube performance videos. Download Extra Kits from Roland Cloud You\u2019re not just limited to the preset kits inside the TD-17 module. Explore an ever-growing range of artist kits at Roland Cloud, including signature setups from pro drummers like Anika Nilles, Craig Blundell, Kaz Rodriguez, and more. Once you have a free Roland Cloud account, just download the kits that appeal to you and dig in. The Essential Tools to Improve Your Drumming First things first: drummers should be able to keep a solid beat before moving on to the exciting stuff. But mastering the basics can be exciting too, as it builds a solid foundation for growing as a musician. The TD-17 module includes a Coach mode to sharpen your skills with daily practice tools, complete with progress tracking that motivates you to improve. Play through warm-ups, develop your sense of groove, tempo, and timing, and even work on your stamina. Deepen Your Sense of Groove With Time Check, you can develop more accuracy when playing to a click track. After a performance, accurate strikes are shown with a percentage value, and you can see whether your pad strikes were on, ahead of, or behind the beat. Fine-Tune Your Internal Timing Quiet Count helps refine your internal sense of time and tempo. As you play, the click drops in and out every few measures. During the silenced bars, you must rely on your internal sense of timing to maintain the tempo as the click returns. The more you use it, the more your \u201cinternal metronome\u201d will improve. Effective Warm-Up Routines Made Easy Coach mode also features a cool warm-up regimen to make daily practice sessions more enjoyable. Choose from three warm-up times and select a starting tempo. Then play through a range of exercises, including rhythm type changes, tempo changes, and a timing evaluation. When you\u2019re finished, you\u2019ll get an overall grade showing what you need to improve on\u2014and be loosened up and ready for some serious drumming. The Importance of Practice \u201cWhen it comes to drums, everyone needs to practice. I was able to develop a career as a drummer by making time to play and pushing myself to learn new and challenging things. Having drums available at home, finding a way to build playing time into a busy life whenever you can, and challenging yourself to learn new rhythms and coordinations are the keys to becoming a better drummer.\u201d Play Along to Video Lessons Streamed Wirelessly from Your Smartphone Working with video lessons has never been easier. Place your smartphone on the module\u2019s panel, connect wirelessly via Bluetooth, and hear the drum lesson audio\u2014along with your playing\u2014through headphones or monitors. Have Fun Improving with Melodics Melodics\u2122 for V-Drums\u2014a free application for macOS and Windows\u2014features a curated set of drum lessons to develop your sense of rhythm, timing, and muscle memory. Subscribers can access additional premium content that includes over 70 lessons, with more added each week. Easily Track Drums in Your DAW Recording acoustic drums can be quite difficult\u2014often needing lots of equipment and expertise\u2014but the TD-17 makes recording at home easy. Connect the module to your computer with a single USB cable and record a stereo audio drum track directly into your DAW. You can also record MIDI through the same USB cable or via the dedicated MIDI output. The TD-17 Module. Highly Rated, Now Updated. Since its launch, the TD-17 module has powered the progress of drummers everywhere. And now, the journey continues with 20 additional preset kits, including 10 previously available with the VAD-306 model only.

AUTHENTIC ACOUSTIC PIANO PLAYABILITY AND HALF-DAMPER PEDAL CONTROL With an 88-key piano action, the GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) keyboard reproduces the touch of an acoustic piano, from a naturally heavy feel in the lower key to a lighter touch in the upper octaves. The GHS keyboard provides a grand piano-style response and feel, allowing rapid note repetition and authentic expressive control. Moreover, there\u2019s a half-damper feature that authentically replicates the damper action on a grand piano, providing rich expressive variation. HARMONIC RESONANCE LIKE THAT OF A GRAND PIANO\u2014VIRTUAL RESONANCE MODELING LITE (VRM LITE) One of the allures of the grand piano is the sympathetic resonance created by the vibration of the entire instrument. The YDP-145 elaborately reproduces this rich sympathetic resonance through a groundbreaking technology called Virtual Resonance Modeling Lite (VRM Lite). VRM Lite creates a richly varied sound by simulating the complex sympathetic tones created when the vibrations of the strings are propagated to the soundboard and other strings, corresponding to the timing and intensity of key playing and pedaling. RICH, POWERFUL SOUND PROVIDED BY THE TONE ESCAPEMENT CONSTRUCTION The YDP-145 uses a newly developed tone escapement construction on the back of the cabinet that emanates sound from inside the piano. This allows you to experience the natural sound radiation and three-dimensional resonance like that of an acoustic piano. RICH VARIETY OF BUILT-IN SONGS, AND INTUITIVE OPERATION WITH SMART PIANIST APP Naturally, the YDP-145 has an authentic grand piano sound, but it also features various other built-in instrument sounds, for a total of 10 Voices\u2014including electric piano, organ, vibraphone, and strings. The YDP-145 also has 353 built-in songs, including 50 famous classical songs, and 303 comprehensive practice exercises from famous methods, such as Beyer, Burgm\u00fcller, Czerny, and Hanon. The instrument is also compatible with Yamaha\u2019s free Smart Pianist app\u2014simply download the app to your smart device and connect it to the instrument*. With the Smart Pianist app, you can easily operate the various Voice functions of the instrument and use it to call up scores of the built-in songs. It also features a comprehensive Piano Room function for changing the tonal quality and resonance settings of the piano sound. * A cable connection is required. Make sure to purchase the correct cable for your smart device. FEATURES FOR GREATER LISTENING COMFORT WHEN USING HEADPHONES The YDP-145 employs new technology that corrects the sound balance optimally according to the volume you set\u2014giving you an exceptionally natural sound that\u2019s easy to listen to and is gentle on the ears, even when playing for a long time. It also has Stereophonic Optimizer effect that lets you enjoy the natural, spacious sound you experience sitting in front of an acoustic grand piano, even when wearing headphones. STYLISH DESIGN MATCHES YOUR ROOM INTERIOR While based primarily on straight lines, it has a stylish design that incorporates elegant curves that are typical of a grand piano. Moreover, you can choose from a variety of color variations the one you like to suit your interior and personal taste.",

    "description": "SOUND The most important element of any instrument is the sound. MODX+ makes all elements of your music sound amazing. MODX+ uses the same technology that powers the flagship MONTAGE: 128 notes of AWM2 (Advanced Wave Memory 2) sample and synthesis polyphony for stunning emulative acoustic instruments, synth sounds and drums. MODX+ also features 128 notes of FM-X (Frequency Modulation) polyphony \u2013 a unique, expressive, highly-programmable synthesis technology for dynamic, electro-modern music creation. AWM2 The AWM2 engine is exclusive to Yamaha synthesizers and offers much more than just sample playback. Each of the 16 AWM2 Parts feature eight programmable synthesizers with 18 different filter types, amplitude, pitch and filter envelope generators, nine LFOs, 3-band EQ and a dedicated dual insert effect with Virtual Circuitry Modeling. FM-X Everything you love about the iconic DX7 meets the latest Yamaha innovations. FM-X produces classic \u201880s or cutting-edge EDM synthesizer sound with incredible dynamic range, power and fidelity. MODX+ goes well beyond the capabilities of the original DX7 with an 8-operator FM architecture, 128-note polyphony, many filter types and more. All with Motion Control for ever-evolving and changing textures to create sounds no one has ever heard before. SMART MORPH Smart Morph enables morphing between FM-X sounds. Its sophisticated A.I. algorithm creates an interactive morphing map from up to eight FM-X sounds. You can \u201cplay\u201d this map from the touchscreen or use the Super Knob to move between two points. The result is a staggering number of interesting and interactive new sounds. 256-NOTE TOTAL POLYPHONY MODX+ features 128-note stereo AWM2 polyphony and 128-notes of FM-X polyphony. Due to the unique architecture of MODX+ and MONTAGE, this polyphony is always available without latency or compromising other features. Integrated Flash Save your music in a flash. MODX+ includes 1.75GB of non-volatile, low latency user flash memory with high speed reading/writing for your own custom samples or synth libraries from here. EFFECTS MODX+ is packed with DSP innovation, power and sound quality to bring you everything from high-definition reverbs to detailed Virtual Circuit Modeling (VCM) effects. Get EDM sound with effects like Beat Repeat, Vinyl Break or Bit Crusher. Use the Spiralizer effect to create the auditory illusion of tone continuously rising or falling in pitch. Add a compressor with sidechain for a modern \u201cducking\u201d effect. Or go retro with vintage effects like Analog Delay, VCM Phaser or a variety of Amp Simulators. Piano players will feel like they\u2019re in heaven, or some other incredible performance space, with piano-focused effects like Damper Resonance and HD reverbs for a super-realistic piano experience. A/D Input A stereo A/D input allows you to bring external sources like analog synthesizers, vocals and other instruments into the MODX+ motion control system. Which means MODX+ control goes well beyond simple onboard effect processing. Control individual parameters with the physical controls or have MODX+ provide \u201cinvisible hands\u201d using Motion Control. Add the Vocoder, Envelope Follower and Auto Beat Sync and it\u2019s like the A/D input on MODX+ becomes an instrument unto itself. Sidechain Sidechain is a popular effect in modern dance music where a pad or other sustain part is \u201ckeyed\u201d to the kick drum. When the kick drum plays, it ducks down the sustained part creating a \u201cpumping\u201d rhythmic effect. Content Beyond being an amazing synthesizer, MODX+ is an expandable content platform. Get new sounds for your MODX+ here. SOUNDMONDO Soundmondo is a social sound sharing network that lets you store and recall MODX+ and MONTAGE Performances and share them with other users. Each stored Performance can be rated, named and given a custom image from your photo library. The Soundmondo app for iOS lets you upload and download new Performances directly to MODX+ with an iOS device. COMPATIBILITY Out of the box, MODX+ gives you access to all the sounds made by our world-class sound designers and artists since we started making synths in 1974. You\u2019ll have one of the largest sound libraries on Earth at your fingertips. MOTIF XF/MOXF MODX+ is directly compatible with MOTIF XS/XF Voices and Performances. DX/TX The free FM converter webapp on YamahaSynth.com makes it compatible with DX7, DX7II, TX802 and TX816 synthesizer content as well. Go to FM Converter B\u00f6sendorfer As part of the MODX+ introduction, Yamaha is pleased to offer an incredible B\u00f6sendorfer Imperial Premium Grand Piano download for FREE to all registered MODX+ owners. Please go for more details. DAW Integration MODX+ Connect is a convenient tool which lets you transfer data between your computer and the MODX+. Song data created on the MODX+ can be transferred to your computer and the Performance data edited on the MODX+ can be saved as a file (.X7B) on the computer. MODX+ Connect, based on Steinberg\u2019s VST3 technology, works as a VST3 plug-in with the Cubase series. The MODX+ Connect also works as the same way as other VST instrument software, allowing you to save the edited settings of the MODX+, or use them for another project. MODX+ Connect also works as an AU plug-in. For AU compatible DAW software, refer to the separate Release Notes. It can also be used as standalone software. MULTI-CHANNEL USB AUDIO INTERFACE As expected for modern computer-based music production, MODX+ features a professional 4-in/10-out, multi-channel USB audio interface. Coupled with two A/D inputs, MODX+ is a perfect centerpiece for any professional recording studio or live computer rig. A single-cable connection replaces the need for an external audio interface. iOS compatible RHYTHM PATTERN Drummer running late again? MODX+ Rhythm Pattern is like a built-in drum machine with easy access to thousands of patterns from a front panel button. Quickly add a rhythm when songwriting, practicing or waiting for the drummer to set up, or show up. CONTROL Every artist wants to sound unique. Empower your creativity, take control and stand out from the crowd. Bring the sophistication of music production automation to realtime live performance with Motion Control. SUPER KNOB The Super Knob is to shaping sound as a conductor is to an orchestra. It directs individual dynamic elements into a single musical expression. Like a conductor, the Super Knob can tell one player to turn up while another turns down. You can change the shape of notes from long to short, bright to dark or move a player from being right next to you to the back of the concert hall. The Super Knob allows simultaneous control of up to 128 parameters in a single Performance. This means you can control mix functions like volume, pan and effect sends or detailed synth parameters like filters, LFOs and Operators. That\u2019s 128 parameters\u2026SIMULTANEOUSLY! You can even control the Super Knob with an FC7 foot controller making it easy to manipulate the sound when playing with both hands. MOTION SEQUENCES Motion Sequences are tempo-synchronized, completely customizable control sequences that can be assigned to virtually any synthesizer parameter and provide incredible new ways of creating sound. Motion Sequences also have dedicated controls on the front panel making it easy to manipulate and change in real-time, providing incredible interactivity and expression. ENVELOPE FOLLOWER The Envelope Follower converts audio into a control source for control of virtually any synthesizer parameter. For example, a drum loop could drive effects parameters for a cool rhythm or a vocal recording could control multiple parameters for a \u201ctalking\u201d synthesizer. The audio can even be a \u201clive\u201d source through the A/D input. Audio Beat Sync Audio Beat Sync (ABS) detects the beat of and external device like an electronic drum kit, drum machine or audio player plugged into the A/D input and synchronizes the MODX+ Arpeggiator, Motion Sequencer or Songs to the tempo of the external input. The MODX+ synthesizer \u201clistens\u201d to live music and plays in time. Rubber coated PB and MW Rubber coated PB and MW MOBILITY Designed for musicians on the go, MODX+ is compact, lightweight and mobile. Lightweight The MODX6+ weighs in at 14.6 lbs, the MODX7+ at 16.3 lbs and the 88-note weighted Graded Hammer Action MODX8+ comes in at a svelte 30.4 lbs. Soft Case The premium soft case for MODX+ is protective, lightweight and stylish. Not just a mere \u201cgig bag\u201d, the MODX+ soft case is manufactured with top-notch nylon, high quality zippers, pockets for pedals and cables and a luxurious inside that will keep your MODX+ protected and looking great for years to come.",

Each ply has been cross-laminated into a highly durable 6-ply, 5mm-thick shell that\u2019s considerably stronger than thicker shells of lesser quality. And because this floor tom features all-maple construction, you can expect a warm, clear sound with loads of punch and resonance. Premium die-cast zinc hoops provide consistent tuning and superior tone Did you know that the hoops on your drum affect far more than your tuning stability? That\u2019s why TAMA created premium die-cast zinc hoops for their Starclassic Maple floor tom. Manufactured via a high-density injection molding process, rather than a conventionally stamped triple-flanged hoop method, these extremely consistent hoops provide uniform bolt contact and give your Starclassic Maple floor tom crisper attack with added high-end resonance.",

This 50th Limited Superstar Reissue harkens back to the first batch of birch-shelled kits that put TAMA on the map in the mid-1970s \u2014 at the time, these were the first-ever 100% birch drum kits to be produced. As you\u2019d expect, this reissue kit retains the unmistakable attack and crisp sensitivity that thrive in the recording studio, with the punch and dimensionality to seamlessly transfer over to stage performances. From its meticulously accurate shell construction and minute hardware details to its period-correct badging and even an assortment of four original finishes to choose from, the 50th Limited Superstar Reissue makes a case for one of the most painstakingly accurate re-creations that our Sweetwater drum gurus have encountered.",

    "description": "Korg Krome-EX 73 Keys Packed with sounds for modern music production Keeping up with a constantly evolving worldwide music scene is a challenge for any electronic instrument designer. With Krome EX, Korg designers meticulously selected the sounds that should be included in today\u2019s workhorse synth workstation. First, they focused on EDM, with effects-heavy polyphonic sounds dripping in rich ambience, searing synth leads, and punchy drum kits that bring music fans to their feet. Ethnic instruments such as kalimba, steel pan, and kokyu \u2014 as well as sound effects like those used in movie trailers and commercials \u2014 are also onboard. Classic bread-and-butter sounds that never go out of style are also a top priority for Korg sound designers. Piano, electric piano, and drum sounds are the foundation for so much music, and they are well represented in the Krome EX 73. You\u2019ll never have to search or go menu diving to find the perfect sound for any occasion. Crucial high-fidelity piano sounds Having great piano sounds is critically important for any serious keyboard workstation. The Krome EX piano sounds were recorded under the supervision of Seigen Ono, renowned authority on DSD recording and mastering. These are beautifully vibrant sounds that build on the success of the German D Grand in the original Krome, further expanding the range of piano sounds in the Krome EX. An upright piano frequently used in pop music has also been included. Electric pianos with luscious warmth and realism For many keyboardists, realistic electric piano sounds are just as important as their acoustic counterparts. Krome EX features three types of electric pianos. To ensure accurate expression response, eight velocity levels have been used, along with lavish amounts of PCM memory. Just one of Krome EX\u2019s electric piano types contains more sample data than the entire sound memory of a typical PCM synth. No EP is complete without vintage amps, cabinets, and classic effects, which in the EX have been meticulously modeled to deliver a fully immersive electric piano playing experience. Drum sounds with resonance fine tuning When producing music on a keyboard workstation, onboard drum kits play a major role. The Krome EX supplies a massive collection of more than 2,500 drum samples to power its 48 preloaded kits. One of the most notable kits is Jazz Ambience Drums. Its glorious sound takes advantage of Krome EX\u2019s high-capacity PCM memory to deliver new levels of realism and clarity. Adjusting the mix balance between the close-miked direct sound and the room mic\u2013enhanced ambient sound lets you create a full, rich drum sound with the exact balance and character you want. Drum Track serves up realistic grooves Simply pressing a single button turns on the Krome EX\u2019s Drum Track feature, which serves up realistic grooves played by professional drummers using Krome EX\u2019s studio-grade drum sounds. You can play along or use them in your music production. In addition to 600 preset patterns inherited from Korg Kronos, there\u2019s generous memory for saving user patterns as well. Drum patterns can be created and used with the onboard sequencer, and they can provide a rhythm guide while you play. You can also use them creatively in your live performances. Dual polyphonic arpeggiators In Combi or Sequencer mode, you can run two arpeggiators simultaneously. In addition to standard arpeggio patterns, the arpeggiators can generate guitar or bass riffs and drum patterns; they can even be used for sound design to create motion-enhanced pads, synth sounds, and sound effects. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re free to edit any of the patterns to create your own custom arps. Never run out of expertly designed sounds In addition to piano, electric piano, and drums, Krome EX sports a generous array of sounds that covers a broad range of music styles. Instantly ignite your creativity with any of the 896 programs or 512 combinations. Each patch has been carefully created by professional studio engineers and musicians to provide exceptional real-world usability for clean, rich backing tracks and soaring solos. Of course, you can customize, tweak, create from scratch, and save your own sounds as well. Workstation wonderland Krome EX has everything you expect in a Korg music workstation, and naturally that includes a 16-track sequencer. But there\u2019s so much more. Krome EX comes with a formidable suite of tools to jump-start your creativity. For instance, pressing the Auto Song Setup function\u2019s REC button starts recording immediately when inspiration strikes while playing a program or combination. Each template song preassigns popular sounds to sequencer tracks through pre-routed effects to suit a specific musical genre. Whip up a quick arrangement using Korg\u2019s Cue List, and build an army of instant-access patterns using the RPPR (Realtime Pattern/Play Recording) feature. Go back, and you can make any changes using convenient piano-roll editing. Intuitive TouchView display Krome EX\u2019s big 800 x 480 pixel TouchView color display shows multiple parameters simultaneously, ensuring great visibility even on a darkened stage. Simply touch the screen to change sounds or edit parameters. Finger-drag editing is also supported, allowing you to use the on-screen sliders and knobs directly. Numerous functions take advantage of the TouchView interface, such as the piano-roll editor, a stopwatch that\u2019s convenient for keeping track of a live performance, and a calculator keypad for entering numerical values.",

Developed from more than 30 years\u2019 research with leading artists throughout the world, Xeno trumpets incorporate their dreams, their experience, and their talents-as realized through the skills and ideas of some of the world\u2019 s best designers and craftspersons. Traditional hand-craftsmanship augmented by cutting edge manufacturing technology has created an extraordinary quality of unprecedented consistency. The Xeno\u2019 s heavyweight construction produces a solid tone core for a rich strong sound that won\u2019 t spread or break up no matter how hard you push it. It blows freely and comfortably, while still providing enough air resistance for quick response and superb tonal flexibility. And the hand-hammered one-piece bell gives an agile, quick response with a beautiful tone. Xeno Bb trumpets offer a choice of bore sizes; medium large for versatility, and large for a broad sound with plenty of power. Bell material options for Bb and C Xenos include; yellow brass \u2013 for clear sound with strong projection, and gold brass \u2013 for warmer, deeper sound. This new generation of Xeno trumpets have an improved, lighter response with control in all dynamics without losing its versatility. A lighter weight piston and valve casing concept as well a new long-type water key",

As with all brass instruments, sound is produced when the player\u2019s vibrating lips (embouchure) cause the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models also use a valve attachment to lower the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.",

    "description": "Opening a New Vein in the Recording Custom Legacy Yamaha\u2019s Recording Custom snare drums have been at the heart of countless records since the late \u201970s. And now, thanks to a partnership with session icon Steve Gadd (Paul Simon, Steely Dan), these snares are better than ever. Each Recording Custom represents a different generation of some of the most celebrated metal snares in the industry. Choose from the dark intensity of brass, the dynamic woodiness of aluminum, or the cutting crack of steel (each sold separately). Shells are expertly formed to just 1.2mm thick with an external center bead \u2014 a first in Yamaha\u2019s history \u2014 and treated to a sumptuous brushed finish with updated lugs and an offset badge. Brass shell packs performance, power, and projection No question \u2014 when you need a big, bold snare sound with limitless projection and sustain \u2014 brass is the way to go. This Recording Custom snare delivers on all counts with its expertly crafted 1.2mm brass shell. Take sensible bites around the edges for unbridled clarity and snare response, or dig in for a brash, overdriven bark. 2.3mm Dyna Hoops enhance punch and openness To coax a fatter, more open tone from its brass shell, your Yamaha Recording is fitted with 2.3mm triple-flanged Dyna Hoops. These hoops are roll formed from thick steel for a great-feeling attack and heightened sensitivity as you move out toward the edge. Smooth, stable, and quiet throw off A dependable snare throw off is essential for studio work. The Yamaha Q-type mechanism on your Recording Custom is quick and stable at dialing in snare tension and stealthy at releasing wires in the middle of a take. Session ready with Remo heads Your Recording Custom snare is ready for the recording light with an included complement of Remo heads. You get an industry-standard Ambassador Coated on top and a sensitive 3mm Ambassador Snare Side to draw out your grace notes. This finishing touch is just another reason Sweetwater drummers stand behind Yamaha Recording Custom snare drums for session work.",
